**1. How expectations influence learning using Bayesian inference**

During learning, the brain is a prediction engine that continually makes theories about our environment and accurately registers whether an assumption is true or not. We have shown that expectation during these predictions affects the activity of various brain networks. The results were published in March and April 2020 in the journals Cerebral Cortex and Journal of Neuroscience.

We identified two key regions in the brain: the thalamus plays a central role in decision-making. The insular cortex, on the other hand, is particularly active when it is clear whether the right or wrong decision has been made. The expectation during learning then regulates specific connections in the brain and thus the prediction for learning-relevant sensory perception.

_Focus on the decision making process_
For the investigation, we used a learning task that focuses on the decision-making process during the perception of skin contact in the brain. It’s like learning a computer strategy game using a game pad, which gives sensory feedback to certain fingers on certain stimuli. The point is that a certain touch stimulus leads to success and that this has to be learned from stimulation to stimulation.28 participants were given either tactile stimulus A or B on the index finger in each trial run. At the push of a button, they then had to predict whether the subsequent tactile stimulus would be the same or not. The probability of A and B was constantly changing, which the participant had to learn from prediction to prediction.


_Strategy analysis_
During the test, the participants’ brain activity was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The researchers were particularly interested in the trial runs in which the participants changed their decision-making strategy. They asked the question to what extent the change in expectations influenced brain activity.

Two brain regions stood out: the thalamus and the insular cortex. The thalamus processes information that comes from the sensory organs or other areas of the brain and passes it on to the cerebrum. It is also called the gateway to consciousness.

_A new role for the thalamus_
Using functional magnetic resonance images, the researchers were able to show that different brain connections between the prefrontal cortex and the thalamus were responsible for maintaining a learning strategy or changing the strategy. The higher the expectations before the decision, the sooner the strategy was maintained and the lower the strength of these connections. With low expectations, there was a change of strategy and the regions seemed to interact much more strongly with each other. The brain appears to be particularly active when a learning strategy has to be changed while it takes significantly less energy to maintain a strategy. 
So far, the thalamus has been viewed as a switch, our results underline its role in higher cognitive functions that help decision-making while learning. So the thalamus is not only a gateway to sensory consciousness, but rather it seems to link it to cognitive processes that serve, for example, to make decisions.

_Affecting sensory perception_
The insular cortex, on the other hand, is involved in perception, motor control, self-confidence, cognitive functions and interpersonal experiences. This part was particularly active when a participant had already made his decision and then found out whether he was right or wrong. Different networks that are anchored in the insular cortex are regulated by expectations and thus seem to have a direct influence on future sensory perception.

**2. How experiences influence brain plasticity**

The excellent motor skills of world class gymnasts amaze everyone. People marvel at the way they precisely control their movements and wonder how the brain structure and function of these elite athletes differ from those of non-athletes. In our two studies from the journal of NeuroImage (2013) and Brian Structure and Function (2015), we acquired diffusion images and resting-state functional brain images from thirteen world class gymnasts and fourteen matched controls. We showed the plasticity changes in terms of brain structure and function after the extensive professional exercise training.
Our findings may help to explain gymnastic skills at the highest levels of performance and aid in understanding the neural mechanisms that distinguish expert gymnasts from novices.


**3. Neural oscillatory dynamics in the motor system** 

Motor actions result from a complex and dynamic interplay of various brain regions which are partly involved in the different cognitive processes of motor output generation, including movement selection (what action to choose), decision (whether to act), timing (when to act) and monitoring (how an action is performed). Identifying the mechanisms that enable these dynamic functional interactions among distributed neural populations has therefore been a fundamental question for motor neuroscience. 

In a series of published papers (Popovych et al. 2016; Wang et al 2017; Viswanathan et al. 2019), we found low-frequency regional phase dynamics in the motor cortex to be associated with movement preparation and execution, irrespective of the forms of movement initiation. However, phase dynamics and power in different frequencies seemed to mediate network interactions during the movement preparation, and spectral power changes were closely linked to movement kinematics during the movement execution, both of which are depending on the forms of movement initiation. The results highlight the roles of neural oscillations in the different cognitive processes of movement, and indicate that oscillations and their different aspects provide a picture of the complex interactions occurring in the motor system involving both phase and power, and spanning a range of different frequencies.
